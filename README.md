----

This repo has been developed as an example of using containerisation for benchmarking in the [TuringBench project](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/data-science-benchmarking/) at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)

The [notebook in this repo](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/scikit-learn-classifier/blob/master/sklearn_classifier_benchmarks.ipynb) provides an example of the TuringBench benchmarking workflow.
